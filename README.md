# ReadMe Generator

  ![License MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-ff69b4)

  ## Description

  I built this project for multiple reasons: some being it is more effecient, and lets be honest it is hard to remember everything that goes into a readme file. This makes it impossible to ever forget! Creating this file will prevent me from going online to find a readme wireframe/template. This project also provided a good foundation knowledge of node and node modules that I can carry on into the next lessons.
